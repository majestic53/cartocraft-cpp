Instructions for compiling Cartocraft from source code

Requirements (tested on):
	- g++ 4.4.3 or newer
	- make 3.8 or newer
	- boost regex 1.42 or newer
	- boost filesystem 1.42 or newer
	- zlib 1.2.3.3 or newer

For Debian:
	- sudo apt-get install build-essential make zlib-dev libboost1.42-all-dev

Building:
	- make

Usage
-------

Cartocraft has just a few options: 

	-p [DIRECTORY] will set the desired input directory
		- Defaults to the current working directory
	-r [INTEGER] will set the render height (0 - 256)
		- Defaults to 256
	-o [FILE PATH] will set the output file path
		- Defaults to ./out.png
	
Here's an example:

	./cartocraft -p ~/.minecraft/saves/world1/region -o render.png

	(This call will instruct cartocraft to read in region files from the directory
	"~/.minecraft/saves/world1/region" and output a png with the name "render".)
